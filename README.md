# rent-a-car_management_GUI
 
With this app a rent a car company can manage their clients, their cars and the users. 
Application is still in development so I expent to make changes and bug fixes.

To install most python dependencies easily, run the following command after cloning (Some may need to be installed manually):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Default login will be `admin - admin`

To run the app you have to run `main.py`
